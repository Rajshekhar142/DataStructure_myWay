Here's a checklist you can follow for linked list problems, followed by a guided solution to your deleteFromFront function.

## A Checklist for Linked List Operations
Before you write any code, mentally (or on paper) go through these four steps. This will help you catch 90% of bugs.

## The "Happy Path": What is the normal, ideal case?

Example: Deleting from a list with 3 nodes: [ A ] -> [ B ] -> [ C ].

Logic: I just need to make the head pointer skip [ A ] and point directly to [ B ]. The old [ A ] node is now "lost" and will be cleaned up.

## The "Edge Cases": What could go wrong or break the "happy path" logic?

The Empty List: What if the list is empty (this.head === null)? Can I delete anything? No. If I try to access this.head.data, the program will crash.

## The Single-Node List: What if the list has only one node: [ A ] -> null?

Logic: My "happy path" logic (this.head = this.head.next;) would set this.head to null. This is perfect! The list becomes empty. So, this case actually works with the happy path.

## Pointers to Track: What variables do I need?

Logic: For deleteFromFront, I only need to modify this.head. I don't need any current or previous "walker" pointers.

## Return Value: What should the function return?

Logic: It's useful to return the data of the node I just deleted. If the list was empty, I should probably return null or throw an error.
